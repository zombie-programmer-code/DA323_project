    "## Motivation for this Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier models like **GANs** and **VAEs** struggle with generalization — that is, they perform poorly on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major issues with GANs include:\n",
    "- **Mode collapse**  \n",
    "  The GAN ends up producing data very similar to only a few types (the “modes”), which adversely affects the variety of obtained multi-modal data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Nonconvergence and instability**  \n",
    "  This can arise due to:\n",
    "  - Inappropriate design of network architecture  \n",
    "  - Poor choice of objective function  \n",
    "  - Suboptimal optimization algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Training instability is a critical problem. For example, if the discriminator can easily distinguish between fake and real images, its gradient vanishes —\n"
